## User-Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Project-Description

To create a portfolio that demonstrates a person capabilities to utilise HTML and CSS. 
There for a few critiera that needed to be reach, which can be viewed in the accpetance criteria below. 


## Acceptance-Criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


## Tracking-Changes

- Created Repository through Github
- Started with basic formating for HTML and then followed by CSS
- As HTML grew, I started to populate it with css style
- Broke down the css style into their section associated with HTML
- Added links to existing applications/projects for viewing 


## Challenges and Notes

- Make sure HTML is layer correctly
- Fill out CSS as you write HTML
- Group and comment both in HTML and CSS for clarity 
- Need more practise on working on both concurrently
- Need more practise on css style and it's properties
